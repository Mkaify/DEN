## Project Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of house prices to understand the key factors influencing property values, identify outliers, and develop predictive models for future price estimation. The analysis focuses on the Pakistani real estate market using data from Zameen.com, providing insights into market dynamics and property valuation patterns.

The dataset contains various property features including location, size, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, property type, and other relevant characteristics that influence house pricing decisions.

## Data Cleaning and Exploration

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about residential properties with the following key features:

- **Location-based features**: City, area, neighborhood
- **Property characteristics**: Size, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, property type
- **Temporal features**: Year built, listing date
- **Price information**: Current listing price

### Data Quality Assessment

**Missing Values Analysis:**
- Identified missing values in key columns
- Applied appropriate imputation strategies for numerical variables
- Used mode imputation for categorical variables

**Data Type Corrections:**
- Converted price columns to numerical format
- Standardized area measurements
- Ensured consistent date formats

### Exploratory Data Analysis

**Price Distribution:**
- House prices follow a right-skewed distribution
- Most properties are priced between PKR 1-10 million
- Luxury properties (>50 million) represent a small percentage of the market

**Key Findings:**
- Strong correlation between property size and price
- Location significantly impacts property values
- Number of bedrooms shows moderate correlation with price
- Property type (house, apartment, villa) affects pricing patterns

## Feature Engineering

### New Features Created

1. **Age of Property**
   ```python
   df['property_age'] = 2024 - df['year_built']
   ```
   - Helps capture depreciation and market trends
   - Newer properties generally command higher prices

2. **Price per Square Foot**
   ```python
   df['price_per_sqft'] = df['price'] / df['area']
   ```
   - Standardizes price comparison across different property sizes
   - Useful for identifying over/under-priced properties

3. **Bedroom-to-Bathroom Ratio**
   ```python
   df['bedroom_bathroom_ratio'] = df['bedrooms'] / df['bathrooms']
   ```
   - Indicates property luxury level
   - Higher ratios suggest more family-oriented properties

4. **Categorical Encoding**
   - Encoded location variables using label encoding
   - Converted property types to numerical categories
   - Preserved ordinal relationships where applicable

### Feature Importance Analysis

Based on correlation analysis and model feature importance:
1. **Property Size** - Most important factor
2. **Location** - Second most significant factor
3. **Number of Bedrooms** - Moderate importance
4. **Property Age** - Negative correlation with price
5. **Property Type** - Affects baseline pricing

## Outlier Analysis

### Outlier Detection Methods

**1. Interquartile Range (IQR) Method:**
```python
Q1 = df['price'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['price'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
outliers = df[(df['price'] < Q1 - 1.5*IQR) | (df['price'] > Q3 + 1.5*IQR)]
```

**2. Z-Score Method:**
```python
from scipy import stats
z_scores = stats.zscore(df['price'])
outliers_z = df[abs(z_scores) > 3]
```

### Outlier Characteristics

**High-Value Outliers (>Q3 + 1.5*IQR):**
- Typically luxury properties in premium locations
- Large properties with premium amenities
- Newly constructed or recently renovated properties
- Properties in high-demand areas

**Low-Value Outliers (<Q1 - 1.5*IQR):**
- Properties requiring significant renovation
- Properties in less desirable locations
- Smaller properties in competitive markets
- Properties with structural issues

### Outlier Investigation Results

**Key Findings:**
- 5-8% of properties are classified as outliers
- High-value outliers are concentrated in specific premium areas
- Low-value outliers often have unique characteristics (age, condition, location)
- Some outliers represent genuine market opportunities or risks

## Predictive Modeling

### Model Selection

**Models Implemented:**
1. **Linear Regression** - Baseline model
2. **Random Forest Regressor** - Advanced ensemble method
3. **Decision Tree Regressor** - Interpretable model

### Model Training Process

```python

y = df['price']

# Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Model Training

}

# Training and Evaluation
for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    
    print(f"{name}:")
    print(f"  MSE: {mse:,.2f}")
    print(f"  R² Score: {r2:.4f}")
